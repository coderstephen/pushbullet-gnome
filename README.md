# Pushbullet for GNOME
A simple GNOME extension for sending and receiving Pushbullet notifications. All incoming pushes conveniently use GNOME's built-in notification tray.

This project is incomplete and likely has some bugs. The current version has the basic receiving functionality down but outgoing features are not yet implemented. The following features aren't yet available but are planned:

- Pushing from the desktop
- Receiving images and files
- Pushing files from Nautilus

## NOTICE
This project is on hold. Other projects are more important to me right now. In addition, for this project to work properly, I need an implementation of a WebSocket client in GJS. If you know of such an implementation give me a ring and I may resume development in the future.
